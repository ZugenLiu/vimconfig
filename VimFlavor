# {{{ BASICS

# {{{ vim-sensible # sensible set of defaults
#
# Think of sensible.vim as one step above 'nocompatible' mode: a universal set of
# defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.
#
# * If you're new to Vim, you can install this as a starting point, rather than
#   copying some random vimrc you found.
#
# * If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose vimrc to use, this
#   can be your neutral territory.
#
# * If you're administrating a server with an account that's not exclusive
#   yours, you can scp this up to make things a bit more tolerable.
#
# * If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference from
#   your vimrc, having this installed will ensure you still have some basic
#   amenities.
