# {{{ BASICS

# {{{ vim-sensible # sensible set of defaults
#
# Think of sensible.vim as one step above 'nocompatible' mode: a universal set of
# defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.
#
# * If you're new to Vim, you can install this as a starting point, rather than
#   copying some random vimrc you found.
#
# * If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose vimrc to use, this
#   can be your neutral territory.
#
# * If you're administrating a server with an account that's not exclusive
#   yours, you can scp this up to make things a bit more tolerable.
#
# * If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference from
#   your vimrc, having this installed will ensure you still have some basic
#   amenities.

# {{{ vim-surround
#
# Surround.vim is all about "surroundings": parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML
# tags, and more. The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add
# such surroundings in pairs.

# {{{ vim-repeat
#
# If you've ever tried using the . command after a plugin map, you were likely
# disappointed to discover it only repeated the last native command inside that
# map, rather than the map as a whole. That disappointment ends today. Repeat.vim
# remaps . in a way that plugins can tap into it.

# {{{ vim-bundler
#
# This is a lightweight bag of Vim goodies for Bundler, best accompanied by
# rake.vim and/or rails.vim. Features:
#
# * :Bundle, which wraps bundle.
#
# * An internalized version of bundle open: :Bopen (and :Bsplit, :Btabedit, etc.)
#
# * 'path' and 'tags' are automatically altered to include all gems from your
#   bundle. (Generate those tags with gem-ctags!)
#
# * Highlight Bundler keywords in Gemfile.
#
# * Support for gf in Gemfile.lock, plus syntax highlighting that distinguishes
#   between installed and missing gems.
