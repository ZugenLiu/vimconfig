# {{{ BASICS

# {{{ vim-sensible # sensible set of defaults
#
# Think of sensible.vim as one step above 'nocompatible' mode: a universal set of
# defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.
#
# * If you're new to Vim, you can install this as a starting point, rather than
#   copying some random vimrc you found.
#
# * If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose vimrc to use, this
#   can be your neutral territory.
#
# * If you're administrating a server with an account that's not exclusive
#   yours, you can scp this up to make things a bit more tolerable.
#
# * If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference from
#   your vimrc, having this installed will ensure you still have some basic
#   amenities.

# {{{ vim-surround
#
# Surround.vim is all about "surroundings": parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML

# {{{ vim-repeat
#
# If you've ever tried using the . command after a plugin map, you were likely
# disappointed to discover it only repeated the last native command inside that
# map, rather than the map as a whole. That disappointment ends today. Repeat.vim
# remaps . in a way that plugins can tap into it.
