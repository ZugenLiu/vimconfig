My vim config
-------------


My little own vim configuration. Use and fork as you see fit.


You will need the awesome [vim-flavor](https://github.com/kana/vim-flavor) ruby
gem to manage dependencies.


## Noteworthy plugins:

 * [sensible.vim](https://gitub.com/tpope/vim-sensible)
 * [easybuffer.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/easybuffer.vim)
