# My vim config


My little own vim configuration. Use and fork as you see fit.


## Dependencies

  * mandatory
    * [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
    * the awesome [vim-flavor](https://github.com/kana/vim-flavor) ruby gem to
      manage vim dependencies.

  * optional
    * [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

## Usage

It's not usable yet. Looots of things still need to be done. However, the main
idea is:

  * git clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/changa/vimconfig ~/.vim`
  * boostrap: `cd ~/.vim && make`
  * add your local settings or overrides in `~/.vim/vimrc.local`
  * Profit!
